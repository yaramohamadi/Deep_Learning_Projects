- [Contrastive Predictive Coding]
- [SimCLR Analysis]
- [Unsupervised Representation Learning]

### Embedding:
- [Visual Question Answering]
- [Transfer Learning using EfficientNet-B0]

### Generative models:
- [Timestep-Wise Regularization for VAE on Persian Text]
- [BigBiGAN analysis + Combining it with InfoGAN]
