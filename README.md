# Deep_Learning_Projects
Some of my Deep Learning projects around Self-Supervised Learning, Generative Models, and Embeddings in applications of vision and NLP.

### Self-Supervised Learning:
- [Autoencoders and PixelCNN for Downstream Tasks](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Autoencoders%20and%20PixelCNN%20for%20Downstream%20Tasks)
- [Contrastive Predictive Coding](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Contrastive%20Predictive%20Coding)
- [SimCLR Analysis](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/SimCLR%20analysis)
- [Unsupervised Representation Learning via Rotation Prediction](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Unsupervised%20Representation%20Learning)

### Generative Models:
- [Timestep-Wise Regularization for VAE on Persian Text](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Timestep-Wise%20Regularization%20for%20VAE%20on%20persian%20Text)
- [BigBiGAN analysis + Combining it with InfoGAN](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/BigBiGAN%20analysis%20%2B%20InfoGAN)

### Embedding:
- [Visual Question Answering](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Visual_question_answering)
- [Transfer Learning using EfficientNet-B0](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Transfer%20Learning%20using%20EfficientNet-B0)
- [Multimodal Movie Genre Classification](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Cafe_Bazaar_Movie_genre_prediction)
