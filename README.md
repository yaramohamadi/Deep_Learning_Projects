- [Contrastive Predictive Coding](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Contrastive%20Predictive%20Coding)
- [SimCLR Analysis](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/SimCLR%20analysis)
- [Unsupervised Representation Learning via Rotation Prediction](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Unsupervised%20Representation%20Learning)

### Generative Models:
- [Timestep-Wise Regularization for VAE on Persian Text](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/Timestep-Wise%20Regularization%20for%20VAE%20on%20persian%20Text)
- [BigBiGAN analysis + Combining it with InfoGAN](https://github.com/yaramohamadi/Deep_Learning_Projects/tree/main/BigBiGAN%20analysis%20%2B%20InfoGAN)
