This project includes analysis of three explainabiliy methods in different applications as follows:

- SHAP for Life Expectancy Prediction
- LIME for Image Classificattion
- D-RISE Saliency Maps for Object Detection


# SHAP for Life Expectancy Prediction

In this section, we analyze the performance of a linear regression model on the [Life Expectancy dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) using Kernel SHAP and Deep SHAP.
